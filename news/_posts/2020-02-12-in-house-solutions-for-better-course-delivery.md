Two applications for course management for staff and students of the department have been implemented and is now available for use. It has functions to monitor students’ results, enter training details, information of companies, and student workload calculation.

We are planning to include the attendance to this so that all data related to the courses is in one place.

Further, the Department’s private wiki is now operational and we are adding material. The department students and staff are invited to add the materials you find useful for academic, academic support or any other general reading/viewing etc.  there.
